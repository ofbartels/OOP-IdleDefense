This showcase explores the intricacies of object-oriented programming (OOP) through the development of a captivating tower defense game. 
Tower defense games are a popular genre in the realm of gaming, characterized by strategic placement of defensive structures to thwart incoming waves of enemies.
In this project, we delve into the principles of OOP to design a robust and extensible architecture for our game. 
Through the implementation of classes, inheritance, and other OOP principles, 
we create a flexible framework that facilitates the addition of new features and entities with ease.
The showcase highlights the significance of abstraction in modeling various game elements such as towers, enemies, levels, and gameplay mechanics. 
By utilizing OOP concepts effectively, we achieve modularity and maintainability, enabling seamless collaboration among developers and ensuring code scalability.
We take advantage of pythons powerful library, pygame, in order to display the logic and objects we created for this game.
Overall, this showcase demonstrates how OOP serves as a powerful paradigm for designing and implementing complex systems, as evidenced by the creation of an engaging and dynamic tower defense game.
